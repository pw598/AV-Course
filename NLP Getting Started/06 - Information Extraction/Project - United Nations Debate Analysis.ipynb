       "'Today, we look ahead to the\\nnew millennium. And at this last General Assembly of the\\ntwentieth century, we look back on a century that taught\\nus much of what we need to know about the promise of\\ntomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last one\\nhundred years: how to produce enough food for a\\ngrowing world population; how human activity affects the\\nenvironment; the mysteries of the human gene. An\\ninformation revolution now holds the promise of universal\\naccess to knowledge. We have learned that open markets\\ncreate more wealth, that open societies are more just. We\\nhave learned how to come together, through the United\\nNations and other institutions, to advance common\\ninterests and values.\\nYet for all our intellectual and material advances, the\\ntwentieth century has been deeply scarred by enduring\\nhuman failures: by greed and lust for power, by\\nhot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold hearts. At century’s\\nend, modern developments magnify greatly the dangers of\\nthese timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resist\\nreasonable efforts to put a human face on the global\\neconomy, to lift the poor, or to heal the earth’s\\nenvironment. Primitive claims of racial, ethnic or religious\\nsuperiority, when married to advanced weaponry and\\n2\\n\\n\\nterrorism, threaten to destroy the greatest potential for\\nhuman development in history, even as they make a\\nwasteland of the soul.\\nTherefore, we look to the future with hope, but with\\nunanswered questions. In the new millennium, will nations\\nbe divided by ethnic and religious conflicts? Will the\\nnation-state itself be imperiled by them, or by terrorism? Or\\nwill we keep coming closer together instead, while enjoying\\nthe normal differences that make life more interesting? In\\nthe new century, how will patriotism be defined — as faith\\nin a dream worth living, or as fear and loathing of other\\npeople’s dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons of\\nmass destruction, or forced to teach our grandchildren how\\nto survive a nuclear, chemical or biological attack? Will\\nglobalism bring shared prosperity, or will it make the\\ndesperate of the world even more desperate? Will we use\\nscience and technology to grow the economy and protect\\nthe environment, or put it all at risk in a world dominated\\nby a struggle over natural resources?\\nThe truth is that the twentieth century’s amazing\\nprogress has not resolved these questions. But it has given\\nus the tools to make the answers come out right — the\\nknowledge, the resources, the institutions. Now, we must\\nuse them. If we do, we can make the millennium not just\\na changing of the digits, but a true changing of the times —\\na gateway to greater peace, prosperity and freedom. With\\nthat in mind, I offer three resolutions for the new\\nmillennium.\\nFirst, let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battle\\nagainst poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of\\nhumanity is left behind in the global economy.\\nGlobalization is not inherently divisive. While infant\\nmortality in developing countries has been cut nearly in half\\nsince 1970, life expectancy has increased by 10 years.\\nAccording to the United Nations Human Development\\nIndex, which measures a decent standard of living, a good\\neducation, a long and healthy life, the gap between rich and\\npoor countries on this measure has actually declined.\\nOpen trade and new technologies have been engines\\nof this progress; they have helped hundreds of millions to\\nsee their prospects rise by marketing the fruits of their labor\\nand creativity abroad. With proper investments in education,\\ndeveloping countries should be able to keep their best and\\nbrightest talent at home and to gain access to global\\nmarkets for goods and services and capital.\\nBut this promising future is far from inevitable. We\\nare still squandering the potential of far too many. As many\\nas 1.3 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day.\\nMore than half the population of many countries has no\\naccess to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 times\\nless likely to use the Internet than someone in the United\\nStates. Forty million people a year still die of hunger,\\nalmost as many as the total number killed in World\\nWar II. We must refuse to accept a future in which one\\npart of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new\\neconomy, while the other lives at the knife edge of\\nsurvival.\\nWhat must we do? We can start by remembering\\nthat open markets advance the blessings and\\nbreakthroughs we want to spread. That is why we in the\\nUnited States have worked to keep our markets open\\nduring the recent global financial crisis, though it has\\nbrought us record trade deficits. It is why we want to\\nlaunch a new global trade round when the World Trade\\nOrganization meets in Seattle this fall. It is why we are\\nworking to build a trading system that strengthens the\\nwell-being of workers and consumers, protects the\\nenvironment and makes competition a race to the top, not\\nthe bottom. It is why I am proud we have come together\\nat the International Labour Organization to ban abusive\\nchild labour everywhere in the world.\\nWe do not face a choice between trade and aid, but\\ninstead the challenge to make both work for people who\\nneed them. Aid should focus on what is known to work:\\ncredit for poor people starting businesses, keeping girls in\\nschool, meeting the needs of mothers and children.\\nDevelopment aid should be used for development, not to\\nbuy influence or finance donors’ exports. It should go\\nwhere Governments invest in their people and answer to\\ntheir concerns.\\nWe should also come to the aid of countries\\nstruggling to rise but held down by the burden of debt.\\nThe G-7 nations have adopted a plan to reduce by up to\\n70 per cent the outstanding debt of the world’s poorest\\ncountries, freeing resources for education, health and\\ngrowth.\\nAll of us, developed and developing countries alike,\\nshould take action now to halt global climate change.\\nWhat has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.\\nThe most vulnerable members of the human family will\\nbe hurt first and hurt most if rising temperatures devastate\\nagriculture, accelerate the spread of disease in tropical\\ncountries and flood island nations.\\n3\\n\\n\\nDoes this mean developing countries must sacrifice\\ngrowth to protect the environment? Absolutely not.\\nThroughout history, a key to human progress has been\\nwillingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true.\\nOne big idea that is no longer true is that the only way to\\nbuild a modern economy is to use energy as we did in the\\nindustrial age. The challenge and opportunity for\\ndeveloping countries today is to skip the costs of the\\nindustrial age by using technologies that improve the\\neconomy and the environment at the same time.\\nFinally, to win the fight against poverty, we must\\nimprove health care for all people. Over the next 10 years\\nin Africa, AIDS is expected to kill more people and orphan\\nmore children than all the wars of the twentieth century\\ncombined. Each year diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis\\nand pneumonia leave millions of children without parents\\nand millions of parents without children. Yet for all these\\ndiseases, vaccine research is advancing too slowly, in part\\nbecause the potential customers are too poor. Only 2 per\\ncent of all global biomedical research is devoted to the\\nmajor killers in the developing world.\\nNo country can break poverty’s bonds if its people are\\ndisabled by disease and its Government overwhelmed by\\nthe needs of the ill. With United Nations leadership, we\\nhave come close to eradicating polio, once the scourge of\\nchildren everywhere. We are down to 5,000 reported cases\\nworldwide. I have asked our Congress to fund a major\\nincrease to finish the job, and I ask other nations to follow\\nsuit. We have begun a comprehensive battle against the\\nglobal AIDS epidemic. This year I am seeking another\\n$100 million for prevention, counselling and care in Africa.\\nI want to do more to get to those who need them most new\\ndrugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns.\\nAnd today I commit the United States to a concerted effort\\nto accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for\\nmalaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases that\\ndisproportionately affect the developing world. Many\\napproaches have been proposed, from tax credits to special\\nfunds for the purchase of these vaccines.\\nTo tackle these issues, I will ask public-health experts,\\nthe chief executive officers of our pharmaceutical\\ncompanies, foundation representatives and members of\\nCongress to join me at a special White House meeting and\\nto strengthen incentives for research and development,\\nworking with, not against, the private sector to meet our\\ncommon goal.\\nThe second resolution I hope we will make today is to\\nstrengthen the capacity of the international community to\\nprevent and whenever possible to stop outbreaks of mass\\nkilling and displacement. This requires, as we all know,\\nshared responsibility, like the one West African nations\\naccepted when they acted to restore peace in Sierra\\nLeone; the one 19 democracies in the North Atlantic\\nTreaty Organization (NATO) embraced to stop ethnic\\ncleansing in Bosnia and in Kosovo; the one that Asian\\nand Pacific nations have now assumed in East Timor,\\nwith the strong support of the entire United Nations,\\nincluding the United States.\\nSecretary-General Annan spoke for all of us during\\nthe Kosovo conflict, and more recently in regard to East\\nTimor, when he said that ethnic cleansers and mass\\nmurderers can find no refuge in the United Nations, no\\nsource of comfort or justification in its Charter. We must\\ndo more to make these words real. Of course, we must\\napproach this challenge with some considerable degree of\\nhumility. It is easy to say “never again”, but much harder\\nto make it so. Promising too much can be as cruel as\\ncaring too little.\\nBut difficulties, dangers and costs are not an\\nargument for doing nothing. When we are faced with\\ndeliberate, organized campaigns to murder whole peoples\\nor expel them from their land, the care of victims is\\nimportant but not enough. We should work to end the\\nviolence. Our response in every case cannot and should\\nnot be the same. Sometimes collective military force is\\nboth appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concerted\\neconomic and political pressure combined with diplomacy\\nis a better answer, as it was in making possible the\\nintroduction of forces to East Timor. Of course, the way\\nthe international community responds will depend on the\\ncapacity of countries to act and on their perception of\\ntheir national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for\\nexample, to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing\\nin a place where we had important interests at stake and\\nthe ability to act collectively.\\nThe same considerations brought Nigerian troops and\\ntheir partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others\\nto East Timor. That is proper — so long as we work\\ntogether, support each other and do not abdicate our\\ncollective responsibility. I know that some are troubled\\nthat the United States and others cannot respond to every\\nhumanitarian catastrophe in the world. We cannot do\\neverything, everywhere. But simply because we have\\ndifferent interests in different parts of the world does not\\nmean we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocents\\nin any part of the world. That is why we have supported\\nthe efforts of Africans to resolve the deadly conflicts that\\n4\\n\\n\\nhave raged through parts of their continent. It is why we\\nare working with friends in Africa to build the African\\nCrisis Response Initiative, which has trained more than\\n4,000 peacekeepers from six countries. It is why we are\\nhelping establish an international coalition against genocide\\nto bring nations together to stop the flow of money and\\narms to those who commit crimes against humanity.\\nThere is also a critical need for countries emerging\\nfrom conflict to build police institutions accountable to\\npeople and the law, often with the help of civilian police\\nfrom other nations. We need international forces with the\\ntraining to fill the gap between local police and military\\npeacekeepers, as French, Argentine, Italian and other\\nmilitary police have done in Haiti and Bosnia. We will\\nwork with our partners and the United Nations to continue\\nto ensure that such forces can deploy when they are needed.\\nWhat is the role of the United Nations of in preventing\\nmass slaughter and dislocation? Very large. Even in\\nKosovo, NATO’s actions followed a clear consensus,\\nexpressed in several Security Council resolutions, that the\\natrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable and\\nthat the international community had a compelling interest\\nin seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in the\\nface of this brutality, I do not believe we would have\\nstrengthened the United Nations. Instead we would have\\nrisked discrediting everything it stands for.\\nBy acting as we did, we helped to vindicate the\\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter to\\ngive the United Nations the opportunity it now has to play\\nthe central role in shaping Kosovo’s future. In the real\\nworld, principles often collide and tough choices must be\\nmade. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful.\\nFinally, as we enter this new era, let our third\\nresolution be to protect our children against the possibility\\nthat nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will ever be\\nused again. The last millennium has seen constant advances\\nin the destructive power of weaponry. In the coming\\nmillennium, this trend can continue or, if we choose, we\\ncan reverse it with global standards universally respected.\\nWe have made more progress than many realize. After\\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Kazakhstan and\\nUkraine courageously chose to give up their nuclear\\nweapons. America and Russia have moved forward with\\nsubstantial arms reductions. President Yeltsin and I agreed\\nin June, even as we await Russian ratification of START II,\\nto begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our cold-\\nwar arsenals by 80 per cent from their height. Brazil has\\njoined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons (NPT), capping a process that has almost totally\\neliminated the threat of nuclear proliferation in Latin\\nAmerica. We have banned chemical weapons from the\\nEarth, though we must implement that commitment fully\\nand gain universal coverage. One hundred and fifty-two\\nnations have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\\nTreaty and, while India and Pakistan did test nuclear\\nweapons last year, the international reaction proved that\\nthe global consensus against proliferation is very strong.\\nWe need to bolster the standards to reinforce that\\nconsensus. We must reaffirm our commitment to the\\nNPT, strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and\\nmake fast progress on a treaty to ban production of fissile\\nmaterials. To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands,\\nwe should strengthen the Convention on Physical\\nProtection of Nuclear Materials. And today, again I ask\\nour Congress to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty.\\nWe must stop the spread of nuclear weapons,\\nmaterials and expertise at the source. Since 1992, we have\\nworked with Russia and the other nations of the former\\nSoviet Union to do that. We are expanding that effort\\nbecause challenges remain, but thus far we can say that\\nthe nightmare scenario of deadly weapons flowing\\nunchecked across borders and of scientists selling their\\nservices en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided.\\nNow, we must work to deny weapons of mass\\ndestruction to those who would use them. For almost a\\ndecade, nations have stood together to keep the Iraqi\\nregime from threatening its people and the world with\\nsuch weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein\\nhas placed in our path, we must continue to ease the\\nsuffering of the people of Iraq. At the same time, we\\ncannot allow the Government of Iraq to flout 40 — and\\nI say 40 — successive United Nations Security Council\\nresolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.\\nJust as important is the challenge of keeping deadly\\nweapons away from terrorist groups. They may have\\nweaker capabilities than States, but they have fewer\\ncompunctions about using such weapons. The possibility\\nthat terrorists will threaten us with weapons of mass\\ndestruction can be met with neither panic nor\\ncomplacency. It requires serious, deliberate, disciplined\\nconcern and effective cooperation from all of us.\\nThere are many other challenges. Today I have\\nspoken about just three: the need to do something about\\n5\\n\\n\\nthe world’s poor and to put a human face on the global\\neconomy; the need to do more to prevent killing and\\ndislocation of innocents; the need to do more to ensure that\\nweapons of mass destruction will never be used on our\\nchildren. I believe they are the most important. In meeting\\nthem, the United Nations is indispensable.\\nIt is precisely because we are committed to the United\\nNations that we have worked hard to support the effective\\nmanagement of this body. But the United States also has a\\nresponsibility to equip the United Nations with the\\nresources it needs to be effective. As I think most Members\\nknow, I have strongly supported the United States meeting\\nall its financial obligations to the United Nations and I will\\ncontinue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed this\\nyear.\\nWhen the cold war ended, the United States could\\nhave chosen to turn away from the opportunities and\\ndangers of the world. Instead, we have tried to be engaged,\\ninvolved and active. We know this moment of unique\\nprosperity and power for the United States is a source of\\nconcern to many. I can only answer by saying this: In the\\nseven years that I have been privileged to come here to\\nspeak to this body, America has tried to be a force for\\npeace. We believe we are better off when nations resolve\\ntheir differences by force of argument rather than force of\\narms. We have sought to help former adversaries like\\nRussia and China become prosperous, stable members of\\nthe world community because we feel far more threatened\\nby the potential weakness of the world’s leading nations\\nthan by their strength. Instead of imposing our values on\\nothers, we have sought to promote a system of\\ngovernment — democracy — that empowers people to\\nchoose their own destinies according to their own values\\nand aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets open\\nbecause we believe a strong world economy benefits our\\nown workers and businesses, as well as the people of the\\nworld who are selling to us. I hope that we have been and\\nwill continue to be good partners with the rest in the new\\nmillennium.\\nNot long ago, I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia.\\nThe people I met there, children and adults alike, had\\nsuffered horrible, horrible abuses, but they had never given\\nup hope because they believed that there is an international\\ncommunity that stands for their dignity and their freedom.\\nI want to make sure that, 20 or 50 or 100 years from now,\\npeople everywhere will still believe that about our United\\nNations. So let us resolve, in the bright dawn of the new\\nmillennium, to bring in an era in which our desire to create\\nwill overwhelm our capacity to destroy. If we do that, then,\\nthrough the United Nations and far-sighted leaders,\\nhumanity finally can live up to its name.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "\"A short walk from this Hall is the delegates' Meditation Room, a refuge from a world deafened by the noise of strife and violence. We want to bring back the idea of worship, Dag Haramarskjold once said about this room, devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves. It is just such devotion that gave birth to the United Nations: devotion to the dream of world peace and freedom, of human rights and democratic self determination, of a time when, in those ancient words, ... they shall beat their swords into plowshares ... nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. The United States remains committed to the United Nations. For over 40 years, this Organization has provided an international forum for harmonizing conflicting national interests and has made a significant contribution in such fields as peace keeping, humanitarian assistance, and eradicating disease. Yet, no one knows better than those in this Hall how the noble ideals embodied in the Charter have often remained unfulfilled. This Organization itself faces a critical hour   that is usually stated as a fiscal crisis. But we can turn this crisis into an opportunity. The important reforms proposed by the Group of Experts can be a first step towards restoring this Organization status and effectiveness. The issue, ultimately, is not one of cash but of credibility. If all the Members of this universal Organization decide to seize the moment and turn the rhetoric of reform into reality, the future of the United Nations will be secure. And members have my word for it: My country, which has always given the United Nations generous support, will continue to play a leading role in the effort to achieve its noble purposes. When I came before the Assembly last year, an important moment in the pursuit of those purposes had not yet occurred. The leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States were to meet in Geneva. These discussions have now been held. For over 15 hours, the Soviet and American delegations met. For about five hours, General Secretary Gorbachev and I talked alone. Our talks were frank. The talks were also productive   in a larger sense than even the documents that were agreed. Mr Gorbachev was blunt; so was I. We came to realize again the truth of the statement: Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. And I did not hesitate to tell Mr Gorbachev our view of the source of that mistrust: the Soviet Union record of seeking to impose its ideology and rule on others. So we acknowledged the deep and abiding differences between our systems of government, our views of history, and the future of mankind. But, despite these differences, we resolved to work together for real reductions in nuclear arms, as well as progress in other areas. Delegates to the forty first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, today I want to report to you on what has transpired since the summit, notably the important letter X sent on 25 July to Mr Gorbachev. In that letter, I dealt with the important issues of reducing nuclear arms, agreeing on strategic defenses, and limiting nuclear testing. In addition to those issues, which concern the military aspects of Soviet American relations, I would also like to address other essential steps towards peace: the resolution of political conflicts, the strengthening of the international economy, and the protection of human rights. Before I do this, however, let me, in the tradition of candor established at Geneva, tell you that a pall has been cast over our relations with the Soviet Union. I refer here to a particularly disturbing example of Soviet transgressions against human rights. Recently   after the arrest of a Soviet national and united Nations employee accused of espionage in the United States   an American correspondent in Moscow was made the subject of fabricated accusations and trumped up charges. He was arrested and jailed in a callous disregard of due process and numerous human rights conventions. In effect, he was taken as a hostage   even threatened with the death penalty. Both individuals have now been remanded to their respective ambassadors. But this is only an interim step, agreed to by the United States for humanitarian reasons, it does not change the facts of the case: Gennadi Zakharov is an accused spy who should stand trial; Nicholas Daniloff is an innocent hostage who should be released. The Soviet Union bears the responsibility for the consequences of its action. Misusing the United Nations for the purposes of espionage does a grave disservice to this Organization. The world expects better. It expects contributions to the cause of peace that only the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union can make. It is for this reason that I wrote last summer to Mr Gorbachev with new arms control proposals. Before discussing the proposals, let us be clear about which weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace. The threat does not come from defensive systems, which are a shield against attack, but from offensive weapons   ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak mass destruction on the surface of the Earth   especially the Soviet Union heavy, accurate ICBMs, with multiple warheads, which have no counterparts in size or number in any other country. That is why the United States has long urged radical, equitable, verifiable reductions in these offensive systems. Note that I said reduction; for this is the real purpose of arms control: not just to codify the levels of today arsenals, not just to channel their further expansion, but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war. Indeed, the United States believes the prospect of a future without such weapons cf mass destruction must be the ultimate goal of arms control. I am pleased to say that the Soviet Union has now embraced our idea of radical reductions in offensive systems. At the Geneva summit last November, we agreed to intensify work in this area. Since then, the Soviets have made detailed proposals which, while not acceptable to us, appear to represent a serious effort. So we continue to seek a 50 per cent reduction of American and Soviet arsenals   with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile warheads. If the Soviet Union wants only a lesser reduction, however, we are prepared to consider it but as an interim measure. In other provisions as well, we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns. So there has been movement. Similarly, in the area of intermediate range nuclear forces, the United States seeks the total elimination of such missiles on a global basis. Again, if the Soviet Union insists on pursuing such a goal in stages, we are prepared to conclude an interim agreement without delay. All this gives me hope. I can tell representatives that the exchanges between our two sides this summer could well have marked the beginning of serious, productive negotiation on arms reductions. The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break, if both sides intensify their effort in the new round of Geneva talks and if we keep the promises we made to each other last November. For too long a time, however, the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions. When the United States began work technology to make offensive nuclear weapons obsolete some day, the Soviets tried to make that the main issue   as if the main danger to strategic stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards, rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in excessive numbers. Still, the United States recognizes that both the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed. And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential offensive use of strategic defensive systems. I have offered firm and concrete assurances that our strategic defense initiative could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can cause mass destruction on earth. I have pointed out that the radical reduction we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that strategic defense initiative cannot be used to support a first strike strategy. Our preference from the beginning has been to move forward co operatively with the Soviets on strategic defenses, so that neither side will feel threatened and both can benefit from the strategic revolution that strategic defense initiative represents. The United States continues to respect the anti ballistic missile Treaty   in spite of clear evidence that the Soviets are violating it. We have told the Soviets that, if we can both agree on radical reductions in strategic offensive weapons, we are prepared right now to sign ah agreement with them on research, development, testing and deployment of strategic defenses based on the following. First, both sides would agree to confine themselves, through 1991, to research, development and testing, which are permitted by the anti ballistic missile Treaty, to determine whether advanced systems of strategic defense are technically feasible. Secondly, a new treaty, signed now, would provide that, if after 1991 either side should decide to deploy such a system, that side would be obliged to offer a plan for sharing the benefits of strategic defense and eliminating offensive ballistic missiles. This plan would be negotiated over a two year period. Thirdly, if the two sides cannot agree after two years of negotiation, either side would be free to deploy an advanced strategic defensive system, after giving six months* notice to the other. As the United States has repeatedly made clear, we are moving towards a future of greater reliance upon strategic defense. The United States remains prepared to talk about how   under what ground rules and process   we and the Soviet Union can do this co operatively. Such strategic defenses, coupled with radical reductions in offensive forces, would represent a safer balance and give future statesmen the opportunity to move beyond it   to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth. In addition to our proposals on offensive reductions and strategic defense, we have suggested new steps in another area   nuclear testing. Just as eliminating all nuclear weapons is our long term goal, so too is a total ban on nuclear testing; but both must be approached with practical steps. For the reality is that for now we still must rely on these weapons for the deterrence of war; thus the safety and reliability of our deterrent are themselves critical to peace. The United States is proud of its record of nuclear safety and intends to maintain it. Nevertheless, we are as I said, ready now to take two important steps towards limiting nuclear testing: first, we ace ready to move forward on ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions, once agreement is reached on improved verification procedures. We have proposed new ideas to make this possible; secondly, upon ratification of those treaties   and in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons   we are prepared to discuss ways to implement a step by step parallel program of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing. Those are steps that we could take in the near future to show the world that we are moving forward. I therefore call upon the Soviet Union to join us in practical, attainable progress in limiting nuclear testing. Just a few days ago I received a reply from General Secretary Gorbachev to my letter of 25 July   and, for the moment, let me say simply that we are giving it As we move towards our goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, it is vital that we also address important imbalances in other kinds of weapons. This is why the United States has proposed a comprehensive global ban on all chemical weapons and why we and our allies have tried hard to break the stalemate in the conventional force negotiations in Vienna. In the Stockholm Conference a major advance has been achieved: a concrete new set of military confidence building measures which But we must remember from the experience of the 1970s that progress in arms control cannot be divorced from regional political developments. As I said at the beginning, political tensions cause military competition, not the other way around. However, while the United States and the Soviet Union disagree over the root causes of political tension, we agree that regional conflicts could escalate into global confrontation. Last year, from this rostrum, I presented a formula for peace which would apply to five critical regional conflicts that are potential flash points for wider conflicts. I pointed out how difficult it is for the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126,000 Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140,000 Soviet backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when 1,700 Soviet advisers and 2,500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1,300 Soviet military advisers and 36,000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an unpopular, repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in Soviet arms and Soviet bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try to subvert and betray a popular revolution. The danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized. Marxist Leninist regimes tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do against their own people. In fact, the internal and external wars often become indistinguishable. In Afghanistan, for example, the puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of people from border areas, Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic communist style   by force? Many will die, to make it easier for the Soviets and their satellite troops to intimidate Pakistan. It is just such transgressions that make the risk o£ confrontation with democratic nations so acute. So, once again, I propose a three point peace process for the resolution of regional conflicts: first, talks between the warring parties themselves, without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible; secondly, discussions between the united States and the Soviet Union   not to impose solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of arms ^and the proxy troops from abroad; thirdly, if the talks are successful, joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the community of nations that respect human rights. In addition to regional disputes, the grave threat of terrorism also jeopardizes the hopes for peace. No cause, no grievance can justify it. Terrorism is heinous and intolerable. It is the crime of cowards   cowards who prey on the innocent, the defenseless, and the helpless. With its allies and other nations, the United States has taken steps to counter terrorism directly   particularly State sponsored terrorism. Last April, the United States demonstrated that it will defend its interests and act against terrorist aggression. Let me assure all of you today, especially let me assure any potential sponsors of terrorism, that the American people are of one mind on this issue. Like other civilized peoples of the world, we have reached our limit. Attacks against our citizens or our interests will not go unanswered. We will also do all in our power to help other law abiding nations threatened by terrorist attacks. To that end, the United States believes that the understandings reached by the seven industrial democracies at the Tokyo summit last May made a good start towards international accord in the war on terrorism. We recommend to the General Assembly consideration of the Tokyo resolutions. Moving to the economic realm, how ironic it is that some continue to espouse such ideus as a new international economic order based on State control when the world is learning, as never before, that the freedom of the individual, not the power of the State, is the key to economic dynamism and growth. Nations have turned away from centralized management and government controls and towards the incentives and rewards of the free market. They have invited their citizens'to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest and, in the process, to provide jobs, to create wealth, to build social stability and foster faith in the future for all. The economic summits of the industrial democracies have paid a tribute to these principles   as has the historic United Nations special session on Africa in Hay. We applaud the African nations' call for reform leading to greater reliance on their private sectors for economic growth. We believe that overcoming hunger and economic stagnation requires policies that encourage Africa own productivity and initiative; such a policy framework will make it easier for the rest of the world, including the United States, to help. The laws of economic incentives do not discriminate between developed and developing countries. They apply to all equally. Much of the recent recovery in the world economy can be directly attributed to this growth of economic freedom. And it is this trend that offers such hope for the future. And yet this new hope faces a grave threat: the menace of trade barriers. History shows that the imposition of such barriers invites retaliation, which in turn sparks the very sort of trade wars that plunged the world in the 1930s deeper into depression and economic misery. Truly, protectionism is destructionism. That is why the United States seeks the assistance of all countries represented here in the General Assembly in protecting the practice of free and fair trade. We applaud the success of the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  trade ministers last week in Uruguay, where agreement was reached to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations covering a wide range of topics important to economic growth, with over 90 other countries members of GATT, the United States is working to maintain the free flow of international trade. In addition to resistance to protectionism, the United States is also seeking to stimulate world economic growth in other ways. Our Treasury bill interest rate is now just over 5 per cent, the lowest it has been in nine years   which provides enormous relief to debtor countries. America new tax structure will open the way for greater prosperity at home, which will contribute to greater prosperity abroad. Finally, the united States is working with other countries to minimize currency swings, to promote stability in the monetary markets, to establish predictability as a basis for prosperity. But, the United States believes the greatest contribution we can make to world prosperity is the continued advocacy of the magic of the market place   the truth, the simple and proven truth, that economic development is an outgrowth of economic freedom just as economic freedom is the inseparable twin of political freedom and democratic government. And it is here that we come to our final category   human rights   the indispensable element for peace, freedom, and prosperity. I note that Mr Gorbachev has used in recent speeches the same categories I have used here todays the military, the political, and the economic; except that he titled his fourth category: humanitarian. The difference is revealing. The United States believes that respect for the individual, for the dignity of the human person   those rights outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Hunt i Rights   does not belong in the realm of charity or humanitarian causes. Respect for human rights is not social work; it is not merely an act of compassion, it is the first obligation of government and the source of its legitimacy. It also is the foundation stone in any structure of world peace. All through history, it has been the dictatorships and the tyrannies that have surrendered first to the cult of militarism and the pursuit of war. Countries based on the consent of the governed, countries that recognize the inalienable rights of the individual, do not make war on each other. Peace is more than just an absence of war. True peace is justice, true peace is freedom. And true peace dictates the recognition of human rights. Commitments were made more than 10 years ago in Helsinki concerning those rights and their recognition. We need only look to the East today to see how sadly unfulfilled those commitments are. The persecution of scientists, religious leaders, peace activists, political dissenters, and other prisoners of conscience continues unabated behind the Iron Curtain. You know, one section of the Helsinki Accords even speaks to: improvement of working conditions of journalists. So, it is clear that progress in the human rights area must keep pace with progress in other areas. A failure on this score will hinder further movement in East West relations. These, then, are the areas of concern and of opportunity that the United States sees in the quest for peace and freedom   the twin objectives of the United Nations Charter. Last year, I pointed out in my address to the General Assembly the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union are deep and abiding. But I also called for a fresh start in relations between our two nations, a fresh start that could benefit our own people and the people of every nation. Since that time, the United States has taken action and put forth new proposals that could lead our two countries and the entire world in a direction we all have long sought to go. Now more than ever, it is the responsibility of the Soviet Union to take action and demonstrate that they too are continuing the dialog for peace. As I have said, I believe that we can be hopeful about the world and the prospects for freedom. We only need look around us to see the new technologies that may some day spare future generations the nightmare of nuclear terror, or the growing ranks of democratic activists and freedom fighters, or the increasing movement towards free market economies, or the extent of world wide concern about the rights of the individual in the face of brute, State power. In the past, when I have noted such trends   when I have called for a forward strategy for freedom and predicted the ultimate triumph of democratic rule over totalitarianism   some have accused me of telling people what they want to hear, of urging them not: to engage the day but to escape it. Yet, to hope is to believe in humanity; and in its future. Hope remains the highest reality, the age old power; hope is at the root of all the great ideas and causes that have bettered the lot of humankind across the centuries. History teaches us to hope   for it teaches us about man, and about the irrepressible human spirit, A Nobel laureate in literature, a great figure of the American South, William Faulkner, once said that the last sound heard on earth would be that of the two remaining humans arguing over where to go in the spaceship they had built. In his speech to the Nobel Committee in 1950, Faulkner spoke of the nuclear age, of the general and universal physical fear it had engendered, a fear of destruction that had become almost unbearable. But, he said: I decline to accept the end of a man. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal ... because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. Faulkner spoke of the old verities and truths of the heart, of the courage, honor, pride, compassion, pity, sacrifice and, yes, that hope which is the glory of our past. And all of these things we find today in our present; we must use them to build our future. It is why today we can lift up our spirits and our hearts; it is why we resolve that with God help the cause of humanity will not merely endure but prevail; that some day all the world   every nation, every people, every person   will know the blessings of peace and see the light of freedom.  \""

       " ' The Soviet Union bears the responsibility for the consequences of its action',\n",
       " ' Misusing the United Nations for the purposes of espionage does a grave disservice to this Organization',\n",
       " ' The world expects better',\n",
       " ' It expects contributions to the cause of peace that only the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union can make',\n",
       " ' It is for this reason that I wrote last summer to Mr Gorbachev with new arms control proposals',\n",
       " ' Before discussing the proposals, let us be clear about which weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace',\n",
       " ' The threat does not come from defensive systems, which are a shield against attack, but from offensive weapons   ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak mass destruction on the surface of the Earth   especially the Soviet Union heavy, accurate ICBMs, with multiple warheads, which have no counterparts in size or number in any other country',\n",
       " ' That is why the United States has long urged radical, equitable, verifiable reductions in these offensive systems',\n",
       " ' Note that I said reduction; for this is the real purpose of arms control: not just to codify the levels of today arsenals, not just to channel their further expansion, but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war',\n",
       " ' Indeed, the United States believes the prospect of a future without such weapons cf mass destruction must be the ultimate goal of arms control',\n",
       " ' I am pleased to say that the Soviet Union has now embraced our idea of radical reductions in offensive systems',\n",
       " ' At the Geneva summit last November, we agreed to intensify work in this area',\n",
       " ' Since then, the Soviets have made detailed proposals which, while not acceptable to us, appear to represent a serious effort',\n",
       " ' So we continue to seek a 50 per cent reduction of American and Soviet arsenals   with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile warheads',\n",
       " ' If the Soviet Union wants only a lesser reduction, however, we are prepared to consider it but as an interim measure',\n",
       " ' In other provisions as well, we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns',\n",
       " ' So there has been movement',\n",
       " ' Similarly, in the area of intermediate range nuclear forces, the United States seeks the total elimination of such missiles on a global basis',\n",
       " ' Again, if the Soviet Union insists on pursuing such a goal in stages, we are prepared to conclude an interim agreement without delay',\n",
       " ' All this gives me hope',\n",
       " ' I can tell representatives that the exchanges between our two sides this summer could well have marked the beginning of serious, productive negotiation on arms reductions',\n",
       " ' The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break, if both sides intensify their effort in the new round of Geneva talks and if we keep the promises we made to each other last November',\n",
       " ' For too long a time, however, the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions',\n",
       " ' When the United States began work technology to make offensive nuclear weapons obsolete some day, the Soviets tried to make that the main issue   as if the main danger to strategic stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards, rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in excessive numbers',\n",
       " ' Still, the United States recognizes that both the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed',\n",
       " ' And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential offensive use of strategic defensive systems',\n",
       " ' I have offered firm and concrete assurances that our strategic defense initiative could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can cause mass destruction on earth',\n",
       " ' I have pointed out that the radical reduction we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that strategic defense initiative cannot be used to support a first strike strategy',\n",
       " ' Our preference from the beginning has been to move forward co operatively with the Soviets on strategic defenses, so that neither side will feel threatened and both can benefit from the strategic revolution that strategic defense initiative represents',\n",
       " ' The United States continues to respect the anti ballistic missile Treaty   in spite of clear evidence that the Soviets are violating it',\n",
       " ' We have told the Soviets that, if we can both agree on radical reductions in strategic offensive weapons, we are prepared right now to sign ah agreement with them on research, development, testing and deployment of strategic defenses based on the following',\n",
       " ' First, both sides would agree to confine themselves, through 1991, to research, development and testing, which are permitted by the anti ballistic missile Treaty, to determine whether advanced systems of strategic defense are technically feasible',\n",
       " ' Secondly, a new treaty, signed now, would provide that, if after 1991 either side should decide to deploy such a system, that side would be obliged to offer a plan for sharing the benefits of strategic defense and eliminating offensive ballistic missiles',\n",
       " ' This plan would be negotiated over a two year period',\n",
       " ' Thirdly, if the two sides cannot agree after two years of negotiation, either side would be free to deploy an advanced strategic defensive system, after giving six months* notice to the other',\n",
       " ' As the United States has repeatedly made clear, we are moving towards a future of greater reliance upon strategic defense',\n",
       " ' The United States remains prepared to talk about how   under what ground rules and process   we and the Soviet Union can do this co operatively',\n",
       " ' Such strategic defenses, coupled with radical reductions in offensive forces, would represent a safer balance and give future statesmen the opportunity to move beyond it   to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth',\n",
       " ' In addition to our proposals on offensive reductions and strategic defense, we have suggested new steps in another area   nuclear testing',\n",
       " ' Just as eliminating all nuclear weapons is our long term goal, so too is a total ban on nuclear testing; but both must be approached with practical steps',\n",
       " ' For the reality is that for now we still must rely on these weapons for the deterrence of war; thus the safety and reliability of our deterrent are themselves critical to peace',\n",
       " ' The United States is proud of its record of nuclear safety and intends to maintain it',\n",
       " ' Nevertheless, we are as I said, ready now to take two important steps towards limiting nuclear testing: first, we ace ready to move forward on ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions, once agreement is reached on improved verification procedures',\n",
       " ' We have proposed new ideas to make this possible; secondly, upon ratification of those treaties   and in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons   we are prepared to discuss ways to implement a step by step parallel program of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing',\n",
       " ' Those are steps that we could take in the near future to show the world that we are moving forward',\n",
       " ' I therefore call upon the Soviet Union to join us in practical, attainable progress in limiting nuclear testing',\n",
       " ' Just a few days ago I received a reply from General Secretary Gorbachev to my letter of 25 July   and, for the moment, let me say simply that we are giving it As we move towards our goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, it is vital that we also address important imbalances in other kinds of weapons',\n",
       " ' This is why the United States has proposed a comprehensive global ban on all chemical weapons and why we and our allies have tried hard to break the stalemate in the conventional force negotiations in Vienna',\n",
       " ' In the Stockholm Conference a major advance has been achieved: a concrete new set of military confidence building measures which But we must remember from the experience of the 1970s that progress in arms control cannot be divorced from regional political developments',\n",
       " ' As I said at the beginning, political tensions cause military competition, not the other way around',\n",
       " ' However, while the United States and the Soviet Union disagree over the root causes of political tension, we agree that regional conflicts could escalate into global confrontation',\n",
       " ' Last year, from this rostrum, I presented a formula for peace which would apply to five critical regional conflicts that are potential flash points for wider conflicts',\n",
       " ' I pointed out how difficult it is for the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126,000 Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140,000 Soviet backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when 1,700 Soviet advisers and 2,500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1,300 Soviet military advisers and 36,000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an unpopular, repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in Soviet arms and Soviet bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try to subvert and betray a popular revolution',\n",
       " ' The danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized',\n",
       " ' Marxist Leninist regimes tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do against their own people',\n",
       " ' In fact, the internal and external wars often become indistinguishable',\n",
       " ' In Afghanistan, for example, the puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of people from border areas, Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic communist style   by force',\n",
       " ' Many will die, to make it easier for the Soviets and their satellite troops to intimidate Pakistan',\n",
       " ' It is just such transgressions that make the risk o£ confrontation with democratic nations so acute',\n",
       " ' So, once again, I propose a three point peace process for the resolution of regional conflicts: first, talks between the warring parties themselves, without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible; secondly, discussions between the united States and the Soviet Union   not to impose solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of arms ^and the proxy troops from abroad; thirdly, if the talks are successful, joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the community of nations that respect human rights',\n",
       " ' In addition to regional disputes, the grave threat of terrorism also jeopardizes the hopes for peace',\n",
       " ' No cause, no grievance can justify it',\n",
       " ' Terrorism is heinous and intolerable',\n",
       " ' It is the crime of cowards   cowards who prey on the innocent, the defenseless, and the helpless',\n",
       " ' With its allies and other nations, the United States has taken steps to counter terrorism directly   particularly State sponsored terrorism',\n",
       " ' Last April, the United States demonstrated that it will defend its interests and act against terrorist aggression',\n",
       " ' Let me assure all of you today, especially let me assure any potential sponsors of terrorism, that the American people are of one mind on this issue',\n",
       " ' Like other civilized peoples of the world, we have reached our limit',\n",
       " ' Attacks against our citizens or our interests will not go unanswered',\n",
       " ' We will also do all in our power to help other law abiding nations threatened by terrorist attacks',\n",
       " ' To that end, the United States believes that the understandings reached by the seven industrial democracies at the Tokyo summit last May made a good start towards international accord in the war on terrorism',\n",
       " ' We recommend to the General Assembly consideration of the Tokyo resolutions',\n",
       " ' Moving to the economic realm, how ironic it is that some continue to espouse such ideus as a new international economic order based on State control when the world is learning, as never before, that the freedom of the individual, not the power of the State, is the key to economic dynamism and growth',\n",
       " ' Nations have turned away from centralized management and government controls and towards the incentives and rewards of the free market',\n",
       " \" They have invited their citizens'to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest and, in the process, to provide jobs, to create wealth, to build social stability and foster faith in the future for all\",\n",
       " ' The economic summits of the industrial democracies have paid a tribute to these principles   as has the historic United Nations special session on Africa in Hay',\n",
       " \" We applaud the African nations' call for reform leading to greater reliance on their private sectors for economic growth\",\n",
       " ' We believe that overcoming hunger and economic stagnation requires policies that encourage Africa own productivity and initiative; such a policy framework will make it easier for the rest of the world, including the United States, to help',\n",
       " ' The laws of economic incentives do not discriminate between developed and developing countries',\n",
       " ' They apply to all equally',\n",
       " ' Much of the recent recovery in the world economy can be directly attributed to this growth of economic freedom',\n",
       " ' And it is this trend that offers such hope for the future',\n",
